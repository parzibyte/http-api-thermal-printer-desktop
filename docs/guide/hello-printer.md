# Hello printer

Not it's time to test if your printer is ready
to be used with the plugin by using the Playground below.

If it works, you may now go to the API description to
start printing programatically

<Playground urlBase=".." nombreOperacion='EscribirTexto' :ocultarOperacionesDisponibles="true"/>

## Troubleshooting

- **My printer is not listed:** You have not installed or shared it properly. Follow the [guide](./install-share-printer.md) again
- **My printer is listed, but it is not printing:** You have installed your printer but you have not share id. Follow the [guide](./install-share-printer.md) again
- **It says the plugin is not running:** Make sure you give the plugin the firewall and OS permissions to
run
