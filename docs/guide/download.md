:::tip
Sometimes the web browser or operating system blocks the download. If the direct
links do not work, try going to the [release](https://github.com/parzibyte/plugin-impresora-termica-v3/releases/tag/3.5.0) and choose the right file in **Assets**
:::

Once downloaded, **extract and execute the plugin** giving it the permissions it asks. It does not show any window except on Windows when getting
printer list.
You can always stop it from the taskbar

:::warning
On Windows, the plugin comes with a DLL. Keep that DLL in the same directory as the plugin
